# Project Report: Casual To-Do App

## Project Overview
This project is a simple casual To-Do application built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. The app allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with a clean and minimalistic interface.

## Features
- Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- Toggle tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Persistent storage of tasks using browser localStorage.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Architecture and Components
- **Next.js Framework**: Provides the foundation for the app with routing, server-side rendering, and optimized performance.
- **React Hooks**: Used for state management (`useState`) and side effects (`useEffect`).
- **Components**:
  - `TodoForm`: A controlled form component for adding new tasks.
  - `TodoItem`: Represents individual to-do items with toggle and delete functionality.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling components with utility-first CSS classes.

## File Structure
- `src/app/page.js`: Main page component managing the to-do list state and rendering child components.
- `src/app/components/Todoform.js`: Component for the input form to add new tasks.
- `src/app/components/Todoitem.js`: Component for rendering each to-do item.
- `src/app/globals.css`: Global styles for the app.

## Usage
- Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
- Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Add, toggle, and delete tasks as needed.
- Tasks are saved automatically in localStorage for persistence.

## Future Improvements
- Add user authentication and cloud storage.
- Implement task categories and deadlines.
- Add drag-and-drop reordering of tasks.
- Enhance UI with animations and accessibility features.
